                <div class="news-content">The cost of charging an electric car at home will rise significantly on October 1. Some electric cars will be so expensive to charge that it would be cheaper to fill an equivalent model with diesel or petrol.

                    51% of electric vehicle (EV) owners bought their car because of the lower running costs that EVs can offer, according to a survey we ran earlier this year.</div>

Just a simple switch to electric vehicles is crucial and significant in limiting fossil fuels and global warming, but without a clean power grid to back them up, they can't reach their full planet-saving potential. </div>
